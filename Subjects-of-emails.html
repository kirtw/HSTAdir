    <h1>Subjects of emails -&nbsp; tldr</h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
      href="file:///home/kw/km7r/mHSTA3/ghH1/HSTAdir/index.html">Home</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Invitation.html">Invitation</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To keep my life in control, monitoring all these emails, please
    follow the following guidelines-<br>
    <br>
    Start the Subject with HSTA&nbsp; of all ResHSTA emails.<br>
    Next Use pretty standard terminology-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Invitation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) You're In<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; Dinner at<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; More Players Needed<br>
    <br>
    Put the date (and year!) as the third part of the Subject, but do
    NOT repeat it in the body.<br>
    Repeating it just allows for errors, trust me.<br>
    <br>
    Send a separate dinner email to the whole Invitation-List so those
    not playing or not in may still easily join us.<br>
    Also, no one reads past the subject !<br>
    I (and everyone) can see the Subject without having to open the
    email.<br>
    <br>
    I love the abbreviation tldr&nbsp; - Too Long Didn't Read<br>
