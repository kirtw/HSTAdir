    <h1>The Invitations-List&nbsp;&nbsp; in ResHSTA Contacts</h1>

    <br>
    This list is maintained by me to include everyone we want to send
    the weekly invitation to play emails.<br>
    <br>
    It is almost everyone in the Contacts, but sometimes temporary
    problems happen and I can remove an email address without deleting
    the contact althgether. Ths may happen when a box gets full, when an
    office generates an autoreply or our contact data is not correct
    yet.<br>
    <br>
    Google, trying to be helpful, sometimes automatically adds emails to
    the Contacts, for example. I dont like this, but cant seem to
    control it.<br>
    <br>
    The list is just long enough, about 100, that it is hard to scan.<br>
    <br>
    I do allow multiple emails per one person, say to personal and an
    office email address.<br>
    <br>
    email addresses change over time and it is hard to remember whether
    sally@yahoo or sally@gmail is most recent...<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, I want to be the ONLY person to update the contact list.
    Simply send me an email with the details and I will do it and then I
    will know it was intentional and I won't have to bug the Directors -
    "Did you add ... ?"<br>
    <br>
    Note that HSTA maintains two separate lists- in ResHSTA gmail and in
    mail-chimp for Newsletter distribution.<br>
    I will also handle communicating with Denise or whoever is currently
    maintaining the mail-chimp or other lists to keep them in sync.<br>
    The membership spreadsheet is a third list.<br>
