    <h1>Use BCC for player list</h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="index.html">Home</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rules&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In gmail and all email, there are three standard fields to designate
    who will get the email, ie to whom it is addressesd and who it will
    be sent to.<br>
    There is a TO: field, a CC: field and a BCC: field.<br>
    <br>
    The last, BCC, stands for Blind CC. <br>
    <br>
    For those of you under the age of 65, CC is the traditional
    abbreviation for sending a paper "carbon copy" to additional people.<br>
    The blind list did not get typed on the original, thus "blinded" the
    recipients to who was on the list to receive a carbon copy.<br>
    <br>
    The ResHSTA Rule: Always use the BCC field to put the list of
    players to whom you want to send an email.<br>
    <br>
    Put ResHSTA itself in the TO: field.&nbsp; This places a marker in
    the inbox.<br>
    <br>
    To populate the bcc field, on your desktop (not the gmail app on
    your phone) click on to: to make the cc and bcc boxes appear if they
    are not visible.<br>
    * Click the bcc label itself at the left end of the bss field.&nbsp;
    <br>
    &nbsp; (sic, not my design- why so obscure??? Hover says
    )&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; This takes you to the contact list.<br>
    * Now click in the right upper quadrant the dropdown "My Contacts" <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Select the "<big><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Invitation List</span></big>".<br>
    * Now click Select All checkbox in the left upper quadrant.<br>
    * Then, finally the "Insert" button at the right lower corner.<br>
    * This should pop you back to your email being composed with 96 or
    so emails in the bcc box.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; You can selectively delete some if you know of a
    problem with some, but should let me know if this gives any bad
    entries.<br>
    <br>
    Be careful at this point, it is easy to send prematurely. I usually
    do this step last, after composing the email body, so the gun is not
    loaded while typing. Sending an erroroneous partial message is more
    embarrassing when it goes to 96 people.<br>
    <br>
    <big>WHY?</big><br>
    <br>
    First it prevents noise when one person inadvertently
    replies-to-all. You have all experienced this and it further enables
    the hate mail exchanges that follow.<br>
    <br>
    Second is to prevent the whole list from falling into spammers
    hands. An email does not contain the whole list from the bcc field,
    but it does when the list is put in either the to: or cc: field. If
    any <big>one member's</big> email gets hacked, the automatic bots
    immediately scrape up emails with lists of email addresses and these
    get used or sold to spammers and we all get more spam.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, when you click the email envelope icon within Google
    Contacts, it puts the selected list in the TO: field and does not
    give you an easy choice of bcc:&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to cut and paste
    the list from to: into bcc:, but Google, in their infinite wisdom,
    chose to block this now.<br>
    <br>
    Also, to complicate my life, there is no way to create a contacts
    email list from the gmail-app. You have to use the desktop-browser
    mode to create the bcc list. Do not ask me why. I have Googled it
    and it is a feature. So use the desktop and browser to set up the
    Invitations email or others for multiple recipients.<br>
